Datatypetests
=============
This repo contains tests that test the Flexible Datatype of Couchbase Server 3.0. You need a libcouchbase library capable of making a hello call to the server, (such as https://github.com/uvenum/libcouchbase), which was forked from the original libcouchbase library. Datatypetests also contains dataclient.c source file that is a modification of the minimal.c file in the original libcouchbase library.
